            <p class="main-llc"><b>Miens & Bearings, LLC</b>, owned and operated by educators, recognized the demand to define career readiness, and the urgency to close the gap between education and industry is greater than ever before. Systems are in place to adequately measure the level of attainment for academic and technical skills. The missing link is the system to track, assess, and clearly communicate the employability skills students mas-ter in secondary and post-secondary education. In response, Miens & Bearings, LLC developed the MB Employability Profile. Our profile uses shared knowledge and a common vocabulary to articulate a student’s development of the behaviors of highly effective employees, their academic focus, and their overall level of em-ployability. The MB Employability Profile offers employers a level of confidence when hiring a new graduate, and closes the gap between industry and education</p>
